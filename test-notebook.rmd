## Importing packages

This R environment comes with many helpful analytics packages installed
It is defined by the kaggle/rstats Docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-rstats
For example, here's a helpful package to load

```{r}
library(tidyverse) # metapackage of all tidyverse packages
```

## Running code

In a notebook, you can run a single code cell by clicking in the cell and then hitting 
the blue arrow to the left, or by clicking in the cell and pressing Shift+Enter. In a script, 
you can run code by highlighting the code you want to run and then clicking the blue arrow
at the bottom of this window.

## Reading in files

Input data files are available in the read-only "../input/" directory
For example, running the code below will list all files under the input directory

```{r}
list.files(path = "../input")
```

## Saving data

You can write up to 20GB to the current directory (/kaggle/working/) that gets preserved 
as output when you create a version using "Save & Run All" 
You can also write temporary files to /kaggle/temp/, but they won't be saved outside of the current session

## Plotting data and output visuals

Rmarkdown scripts can display plots inline with the flow of the analysis. Here is an example for an in-built dataset:

```{r}
mtcars %>% 
  ggplot(aes(hp, mpg)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(x = "Horse Power", y = "Miles per Gallon", title = "Car Parameters")
```
